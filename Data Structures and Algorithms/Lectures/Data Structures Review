Intro to Graphs and Trees
	Trees as a Data Structure
	Binary Trees
	Binary Trees as ADTs

Nonlinear Data Structures
	Non sequential (can't access every element by going to the next)
	A signle element can be connected to multple other elements
	Graphs and Trees are examples of nonlinear data structures

Graphs and Trees
	Widley used data structures, much more powerful than sequential data structures
	Examples of applications:
		Databases
		Network Security
		Search Engines
		Social Media
		Navigation
		Biochemistry
		Compilers
