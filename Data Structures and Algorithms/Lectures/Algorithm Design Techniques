Algorithm Design Techniques

An algorithm design technique is a genreal problem solving paradigm for a set of problems that share similar characteristics
There is an overalpping between different algorithm design techniques (e.g. the same problem could be solved by more than one technique)
Typically for a given problem one or more algorithms design techniques could solve this problem. However, usually one technique is superior than the other
Some problems will require applying one or more algorithm deisgn technique
