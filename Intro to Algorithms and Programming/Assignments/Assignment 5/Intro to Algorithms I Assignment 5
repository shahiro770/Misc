Intro to Algorithms & Programming I Assignment 5

1. The two errors are:
	1) product is being initialized outside of the function (must be initialized inside)
	2) height parameter in the function is missing a type (must be declared with a numeric type)

Correct Version:

	double triangle_area (double base, double height)
	{
		double product;
		product = base * height;
		return product / 2;
	}

2. 	a) Legal
	b) Legal
	c) Legal
	d) Legal
	e) Legal

5. You can have a maximum of infinity + 2 i declarations:
	-1 i declaration as a global variable (static storage variable and file scope)
	-1 i declaration as a local variable to main
	-Infinitely many i declarations in if statements that are containted inside one another (automatic variables with deeper and deeper block scope)

	Out of all these i variables, the i variables scoped inside the main function should always be avoided to improve software maintainability. These i variables contained inside if statements of increasing depth are confusing for readers to understand and are often messy as a result of the depth. There is also little meaning to the names of each of those i variables, indicating a lack of clarity in such code.
