Personal Kent Advice
-----------------------
Kent used to be a terrible student
	Handed shit in late
	He was a god at spelling bee though 

Most of us are cursed cause we were smart in highschool ()

Kent's wife told him every day you have a class, review what you did 
After 7 minutes of leaving a lecture, you lose everything 
Go somewhere quiet right after a lecture and review real quick, your retention rate will spike
